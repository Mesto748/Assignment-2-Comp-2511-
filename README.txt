Hello, World!
Fixed accessibility issues from automated website analysis,
issues were the empty table contents (not containing text), 
and the sidebar element (multiple headers and label not used)

For the Perceivable category, some of the issues that we encountered while building the website include a lack of contrast between different elements such as colors and text, a somewhat confusing web structure, and a lack of image elements. To make our website eligible and accessible for all of our viewers, we made some changes. First, we chose a grayscale background image. This allows for the main content on the website to stand out and to leave a pleasant design for the site. We use the colours gold and purple to stand out from the grayscale theme of our website. The gold colour serves as the eye catcher for elements while the purple acts as a complimentary colour while also adding contrast to the gold. For any text related element, we made sure to make our titles have more weight in order to stand out to our viewers. Our images required some support from the first assignment. To increase their use, we added borders and pop-up text which includes both the link and a description of the image. While the user’s cursor is hovering above the image, they will see the title of the image including the pop-up text. As we made changes to our website, we took into consideration how viewers would read the website. Because of this, we made some changes to our structure. In addition, we fixed our table by adding content within the cells and we adjusted our sidebar element for smaller devices.
For the Operable category, we made sure to add specific elements to make our site operable for viewers. On our index/homepage, we included three buttons which redirected to different pages on the website. These buttons include Shop, About Us, and Contact. When you click on one of these buttons, such as About Us, the About Us button will no longer be visible and will be replaced with a Home button. To make our site operable, we made sure that our Home button will always be the first button on each website. When the viewer hovers over any element such as the nav buttons or the images on the website, different kinds of ‘Focus Rings’ are used. For our nav buttons, the text becomes gold and increases in weight through a very miniscule animation. As for our images, the gold border becomes purple and increases in weight with a textbox. However, this differs with the images in Shop as the Shop images only get an increase in border weight and have an opaque background through a short animation. 
There are not a lot of remarkable things to talk about in the Understandable category. This is due to the previous fixes in the other categories. However, there is still content that was added. We made sure that our text would stand out due to our monochromatic theme. To make the white text stand out, we chose to use the “Inter” font. This font is versatile in which it is very pleasant to read and can also be customized to different forms that we wish. In addition, we also made a semi-transparent black box to add contrast to the white text. To prevent more confusion for our viewers, we decided to not overcomplicate the website by allowing features to do what they are supposed to do, such as buttons leading to pages that they are meant to redirect the user to. The layout is also structured in a way that should make sense to the user.
For the Robust category, we took into consideration the different kinds of devices that users may utilize when they are on our website. For example, the main screen that we focussed on are basic computer screens. We based all of our adjustments for other screens on this type of screen. When the display is slightly smaller (such as tablets), the website will become more compact to have a similar look to that of its computer-size display. But at a certain point as the screen display gets smaller, the nav buttons collapse into a side navigation menu with a hamburger image to represent it. This way, the main content is unscathed to adjust to the display sizes. The images in the homepage crop themselves on smaller displays so that only the ‘main’ or ‘important’ part of the photo is present and does not take too much space. The shop images will collapse into smaller images to fit the display of the user’s device.
